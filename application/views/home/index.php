		<h4>A Solid Base</h4>

		<p>Bonfire is based on <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter" target="_blank">CodeIgniter <?php echo CI_VERSION; ?></a>, a proven PHP framework. In order to make the best use of it, you should be comfortable with CodeIgniter and its <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/" target="_blank">documentation</a> first.</p>

		<p>We use Twitter's <a href="">Bootstrap</a> front-end framework and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> as the basis of the CSS and Javascript.</p>
