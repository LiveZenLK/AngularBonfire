<h3>Due to some bug inherent in my architecture which was possibly inherited from the previous dev team (Mum and Dad), or somewhere during a sprint in my early lifecycle I am completely unable to self edit. That is to say I am a highly capable editor, but whenever I fall into the trap of self editing I get stuck in a infinate loop of refining the minuate of details, or like looking up words in the dictorionary. This means in five years as a developer I have never managed to get more than two articles into a blog. That and I have never really felt like i have useful opinion on anything before. So this time round I'm just writing as I go, all mistakes are my own, all errors are learning tools for the reader, and hoping that it's useful for someone.</p>
